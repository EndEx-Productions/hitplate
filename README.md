This repo is for storing code related to the airsoft BB hit detection system.

Primary design revolves around usign piezoelectric sensors attached to metal plates to detect vibration caused by BB impact. This signal is interpreted by a microcontroller and outputs sound/lights to indicate a positive hit. This output can be LED strips to indicate a health bar, buzzer/speaker to indicate the hit, or any variety of other actions.

The initial design has the sensors attached to 18 gauge metal plates with double sided tape. You will probably have to adjust the code depending on your sensor setup. Have fun testing!
